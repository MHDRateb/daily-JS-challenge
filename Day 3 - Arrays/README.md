Today's challenges will be around Arrays. You should work inside the file called `day-3.js`. You are given a big array called, surprise surprise... `array`. If you want to, 
you can always create a smaller array for testing purposes while working on a problem. 

### Task 1. 
Create a function called `sumElementsOfArray`. The input to the function should be the given array. 
The function should output a sum of all its elements, i.e.

```
var array = [1,2,3];

sumElementsOfArray(array);

Output -> 6, because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
```
### Task 2.
